# exercise-is-js
A JavaScript exercise I did that makes a number of fetch requests and compiles console info based on the responses.

Notes/instructions:

Check the console for log messages for each stage of the process.\
Buttons must be clicked in the correct order.\
NB: All requests from the API will fail 1/5 times - this will be detected in the console log. If this happens, click that button again.\
You may have to start again if you get CORS-related errors.\
The JavaScript uses fetch (so would need a babel polyfill to work in Internet Explorer).
